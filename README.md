# CalVAD DB GeoExtensions

This isn't actually specifically related to CalVAD, but the name got
in there early and I haven't gotten around to changing it.

Deploy with sqitch at the moment

```
sqitch deploy
```

But I'm working on using npm instead.

# using npm

to use NPM to install, do something like:

```
SQITCH_DB_URI="db:pg:mydb" npm install
```
